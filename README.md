# crystalCaveQuest
This is a script that automatically farms XP via the Crystal Cave Quest in Dragonfable. 

I wrote this script because farming takes up too much time, so I wanted to automate the process. It is also very interesting to see if I 
could actually create a bot. 

I hardcoded the values inside the bot, and it works best if the quest is played in a Chrome browser, zoomed in by 125%, and when icons are 
scaled to 100%. (To change the scale, go to Desktop, right click and select 'Display Settings'. Then change the 'Scale and Layout' to 100%)

This script automatically runs when launched in the console. However, this does not account for cases when the monster misses attacks.
